# BankAccount
C# Program that conveys data of Bank Account Holders

// Summary
I created this C# program using Microsoft Visual Studio. In this program, I created a class client which allows users to enter a person's name, number and savings. Furthermore, I developed an enumeration that conveys four different account types: checking, savings, transactional and money market. Public info stores the data while Public void print outputs data for each bank account. Finally, the main allows users to create data about the clients and print client information.
